# Models-and-Toys

Folowing a Data Analyst Training at Wild Code School, this is the first projet that my colleagues and I have built avec the aim to develop our MySQL and Tableau skills. 

<b>1 - Introduction</b> 

With a group of five members, we were commissioned by a fictious company selling models and scale models. This company sent the database with all the information that we could have to develope the project, such as : <i>the list of employees, products, orders and so on</i>. Thus, we were in charge to develop a dashboard which the director of the company can refresh each morning to have the latest information oin order to take decision and manage the company. 

<b>2 - Objective</b> 

Our dashboard must have four (4) main topics: <i>sales, finance, logistics and human resources.</i>
  - <b>Sales:</b> The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year.
  - <b>Finances:</b> The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country and the orders that have not yet been paid.
  - <b>Logistics:</b> The stock of the 5 most ordered products.
  - <b>Human Resources:</b> Each month, the 2 sellers with the higest turnorver 

<b>3 - Tools</b>
